# Weather-Journal App Project

## Project Objective
This project was about working with Web APIs and asynchronous code, creating a web app that uses OpenWeatherMap API to get weather based on user's location, and dynamically update UI.

Building
To run the project I followed these steps:

```
npm install express
npm install body-parser
npm install cors
```

1. Added POST and GET routes to ensure correct retrieval of data from the server.
2. Acquired API credentials from OpenWeatherMap website.
3. Created async functions to fetch weather data and store it on my local server.
4. Set up a function that updated UI dynamically.

To run the project:
```
node server.js
```
